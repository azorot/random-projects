Project: Cryptocurrency Anomaly Detection and Volatility Prediction

1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Data Sources:
Use APIs like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, or CoinGecko to access historical price data (OHLCV - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
Consider on-chain data from blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan, Blockchair) for insights into transaction volume, wallet activity, and gas fees.
Explore social media APIs (Twitter, Reddit) to gather sentiment data.
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Resample data to appropriate timeframes (e.g., 1-minute, 1-hour, 1-day).
Calculate technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD) to enrich the dataset.
Feature Engineering:
Create features that capture volatility (e.g., rolling standard deviation, average true range).
Generate features that represent market momentum (e.g., rate of change, price derivatives).
Incorporate on-chain metrics and sentiment data as relevant features.
2. Anomaly Detection:

Isolation Forests:
Effective for identifying outliers in high-dimensional data.
Implement using scikit-learn.
Autoencoders (Deep Learning):
Train an autoencoder to reconstruct normal market behavior.
Anomalies are detected when the reconstruction error is high.
Use tensorflow or pytorch.
LSTM-Based Anomaly Detection:
Train an LSTM to predict future price movements.
Large prediction errors indicate anomalies.
Implement using tensorflow or pytorch.
Statistical Methods:
Z-score analysis.
Modified Z-score analysis.
3. Volatility Prediction:

Time Series Models:
ARIMA, GARCH, and their variants.
Use statsmodels or arch.
LSTM Networks:
Train an LSTM to predict future volatility.
Use historical volatility and other features as input.
Implement using tensorflow or pytorch.
Machine Learning Models:
Random forest regressors, or gradient boosting regressors.
These can be trained to predict volatility based upon the engineered features.
4. Evaluation and Backtesting:

Anomaly Detection Evaluation:
Use metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.
Visualize anomalies on price charts to assess their relevance.
Volatility Prediction Evaluation:
Use metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate prediction accuracy.
Create visualisations of predicted verses actual volatility.
Backtesting:
Develop a backtesting framework to simulate trading strategies based on anomaly detection and volatility predictions.
Account for transaction costs and slippage.
Evaluate the profitability and risk-adjusted returns of the strategies.
5. Visualization and Reporting:

Interactive Dashboards:
Use plotly or bokeh to create interactive dashboards that display price charts, anomaly scores, and volatility predictions.
Visualize on-chain data and sentiment analysis results.
Reports:
Generate reports that summarize the findings of your analysis.
Include visualizations and statistical metrics.
Key Considerations for Crypto:

24/7 Market: Cryptocurrencies trade 24/7, so consider the impact of overnight volatility.
Market Manipulation: Be aware of potential market manipulation and its impact on anomaly detection.
Regulatory Changes: Stay informed about regulatory changes that could affect the cryptocurrency market.
Flash Crashes: Crypto is known for flash crashes. your model should ideally be able to identify these.
On-Chain Data: Utilize on-chain data whenever possible, as it provides valuable insights into market activity.
Sentiment: Sentiment is a large driver of crypto prices, so including sentiment analysis will likely improve your models.
By following these steps, you can create a robust and insightful project that explores anomaly detection and volatility prediction in the cryptocurrency market.
